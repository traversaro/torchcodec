class DecoderTransform(ABC):
    """Base class for all decoder transforms.

    A *decoder transform* is a transform that is applied by the decoder before
    returning the decoded frame.  Applying decoder transforms to frames
    should be both faster and more memory efficient than receiving normally
    decoded frames and applying the same kind of transform.

    Most ``DecoderTransform`` objects have a complementary transform in TorchVision,
    specificially in `torchvision.transforms.v2 <https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html>`_.
    For such transforms, we ensure that:

      1. The names are the same.
      2. Default behaviors are the same.
      3. The parameters for the ``DecoderTransform`` object are a subset of the
         TorchVision :class:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.Transform` object.
      4. Parameters with the same name control the same behavior and accept a
         subset of the same types.
      5. The difference between the frames returned by a decoder transform and
         the complementary TorchVision transform are such that a model should
         not be able to tell the difference.

            input_dims (Tuple[Optional[int], Optional[int]]): The dimensions of
                the input frame in the form (height, width). We cannot know the
                dimensions at object construction time because it's dependent on
                the video being decoded and upstream transforms in the same
                transform pipeline. Not all transforms need to know this; those
                that don't will ignore it. The individual values in the tuple are
                optional because the original values come from file metadata which
                may be missing. We maintain the optionality throughout the APIs so
